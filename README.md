Antolka Admin interface

This is source code used to create and administrate Antolka game content.
Antolka game source code is not public as I want to keep the game ownership (including story and art direction).

To use the admin interface you need a SQL dump of the game, a MySQL (or MariaDB) server and PHP >= 7.4 with composer.
